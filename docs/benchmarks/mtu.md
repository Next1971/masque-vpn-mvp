# MASQUE connection MTU test matrix

This document tracks MTU validation for MASQUE CONNECT-IP connections across client platforms and network types.

## Interpretation

- **Largest DF-safe MTU**: highest tested interface MTU for which the DF/no-fragment probe succeeds.
- **Connect**: tunnel connection is established successfully.
- **Ping**: baseline ICMP test succeeds without observed packet loss.
- **HTTP/Curl**: HTTP download completes successfully.
- A successful HTTP download does not override a failed DF probe. DF failure is recorded as a possible PMTU/fragmentation risk.

## Preliminary implementation recommendation

Use **MTU 1369** as the preliminary default for future MASQUE client releases.

Rationale:

- Linux and Android Wi-Fi tests pass with MTU 1400.
- Android mobile testing on Beeline also passes with MTU 1400.
- The lowest successful tested path is Android mobile data on MTS: MTU 1370 passes, while MTU 1380 has 100% DF-probe loss.
- Selecting 1369 keeps a 1-byte margin below that observed lower boundary.

This is a conservative interim recommendation, not a universal PMTU guarantee. **v1.5.1** ships TUN MTU **1369** as the client default. Revisit it after more carriers and any MTU/PMTU handling changes.

**Preliminary result:** MTU **1400** is the largest tested value for which the Android Wi-Fi DF probe succeeds.

### Android over mobile data — MTS — 2026-08-31

This is the lowest-successful mobile path observed so far and is used as the conservative baseline for the interim default recommendation.

| 1350 | 0% | 118.0 | 0% | 148.5 | Pass | Source screenshot labels this row `1350 m0b`; treated as MTU 1350 |
| 1370 | 0% | 127.1 | 0% | 118.2 | **Pass** | Largest successful tested MTU |
| 1380 | Not recorded | Not recorded | 100% | - | Fail | Tested separately; DF probe has 100% loss |
| 1400 | 0% | 99.7 | 100% | - | Fail | DF probe lost |

| 1500 | 0% | 121.0 | 100% | - | Fail | DF probe lost |

**Preliminary result:** MTU **1370** is the largest successful tested value for Android mobile data on MTS. MTU **1380** has 100% DF-probe loss. Use MTU **1369** as the preliminary release default to preserve a small margin below this observed boundary.

### Android over mobile data — Beeline — 2026-08-31

| MTU | DF probe result | Notes |
|---:|---|---|
| 1400 | Pass | Tested successfully; detailed measurements were not recorded in this document |

**Preliminary result:** MTU **1400** was tested successfully on Beeline mobile data. MTS is retained as the conservative baseline because it has the lower observed maximum.
