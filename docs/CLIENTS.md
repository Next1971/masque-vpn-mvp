# Issuing client configs (one bundle per device)

Every device that connects gets its **own** client bundle (its own certificate).
This is not optional: from **v1.3** the server assigns each client a unique
address from the pool (`10.8.0.0/24`) **and remembers it by the client
certificate CN**, so reconnect (sleep, Wi-Fi → LTE) keeps the same `/32`. Two
devices sharing the same bundle would still collide on that address, and only
one of them would receive traffic.

> **Rule of thumb:** N devices → N bundles. Never reuse one bundle on two
> devices at the same time.

## Generate bundles

Configs are produced by [`server/scripts/gen-config.sh`](../server/scripts/gen-config.sh).

### First time (creates a new CA + server cert + client bundles)

```bash
cd server/scripts
./gen-config.sh --host YOUR_SERVER_HOST --ip YOUR_SERVER_IP --port 443 --clients 2
```

- `--host` — public hostname or IP that clients dial (used as TLS server name).
- `--ip` — extra IP added to the server certificate SAN (use when `--host` is a
  domain but clients may also connect by raw IP).
- `--port` — UDP port the server listens on.
- `--clients N` — how many client bundles to generate.

Output lands in `./out`:

```
out/
  ca/                 # internal CA (ca.crt + ca.key) — KEEP ca.key PRIVATE
  server/             # server.crt + server.key (deploy to the server)
  client-1/           # bundle for device #1
  client-2/           # bundle for device #2
  ...
```

Each `client-N/` contains:

- `profile.masque` — **Android / iOS / Windows GUI** profile (self-contained: inline PEM certs). Import this single file in the app.
- `profile.client.toml` + `certs/` — **Windows/Linux** console profile and its certificate files (keep them together).

## Add more devices later (reuse the SAME CA)

To issue additional bundles without re-provisioning existing clients, reuse the
existing CA. Existing devices keep working; you only hand out the **new**
bundles.

```bash
cd server/scripts
./gen-config.sh --host YOUR_SERVER_HOST --ip YOUR_SERVER_IP --port 443 \
  --reuse-ca ./out/ca --clients 8
```

This regenerates `client-1 … client-8`. The numbering restarts at 1, so take
only the new ones you need (e.g. `client-3 … client-8`) — the certificates are
still valid because they are signed by the same CA.

> Reusing the CA is what keeps previously deployed clients unaffected. If you
> create a *new* CA, every existing client stops trusting the server.

### Windows setup app (from #9)

[`masque-setup.exe`](../windows/README.md#install-the-server-from-windows-masque-setupexe) issues **one** `profile.masque` per click, CN `masque-client-9`, then `10`, … up to 253 app bundles. It does **not** write the old Windows `profile.client.toml` tree; import `profile.masque` on Android, iOS, and in the Windows GUI.

**#1–8 are test CNs.** They were used in early testing. The app never reissues them and does not rotate the server certificate, so those clients stay valid. They are **not** counted in the app’s `N/253` figure. You do not need to regenerate them for the server to keep working.

CLI equivalent (does not replace `server.crt`):

```bash
./gen-config.sh --host YOUR_SERVER_HOST --port YOUR_PORT \
  --reuse-ca /opt/masque/ca --client-only --android-only --index 9 --out /tmp/c9
```

## Distribute bundles

- Send each device its own bundle **out-of-band** (not committed to git).
- **Android / iOS:** import `profile.masque` (single file). On phones you can open the
  file directly; on Android TV use the **paste-text** import (see below).
- **Windows/Linux:** copy `profile.client.toml` together with its `certs/`
  folder.

## Android TV import

Android TV boxes frequently have **no file manager**, so importing
`profile.masque` from a file may not work. Use the reliable path:

1. Open `profile.masque` (from the device's bundle) on a phone or PC and copy
   the entire contents.
2. On the TV, prefer **“Paste config from clipboard”** (one remote click; copy the file on a phone/PC first). If the clipboard is empty, use **“Import profile (paste text)”**.
3. Then **Connect**.

## Security

- **Never commit** `*.key`, keystores, `keystore.properties`, or real client
  profiles — they are git-ignored. Distribute bundles out-of-band.
- **Back up `out/ca/ca.key`.** Losing it means you can no longer issue new
  client certificates without re-provisioning every client.
- **Revoke a leaked bundle** by appending its CN (`masque-client-N`) to
  `/opt/masque/blocked_cns` and restarting `masque.service` (v1.5.1). This is a
  denylist, not a CRL. See [server README](../server/README.md#revoking-a-client-cn).
  `masque-setup.exe` can do the same from Windows.
