# MASQUE VPN — Windows Client

A minimal Windows VPN client built on top of a portable Go core (`clientcore`)
shared with the Android and Linux clients. It speaks **QUIC + HTTP/3 CONNECT-IP
(MASQUE, RFC 9484)** with mutual TLS to a MASQUE server, and tunnels all traffic
through a Wintun adapter.

This repository contains everything needed to **build `vpn-client.exe` from
source on Windows**.

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.21+** for Windows — https://go.dev/dl/ (verify with `go version`)
- Windows 10/11 x64
- Administrator rights (only to **run** the VPN, not to build it)

No CGO, no C toolchain required — it is pure Go.

---

## Build

### Option A — script

From `cmd.exe`:
```bat
scripts\build.bat
```
or from PowerShell:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\build.ps1
```

### Option B — manual

```bat
go mod download
set GOOS=windows
set GOARCH=amd64
go build -trimpath -ldflags "-s -w" -o dist\vpn-client.exe .\cmd\vpn-client
```

Output: **`dist\vpn-client.exe`** (~11 MB). `dist\wintun.dll` is already
included and must stay next to the EXE.

---

## Configure

1. Copy the profile template and edit it:
   ```bat
   copy profile.client.toml.example dist\profile.client.toml
   ```
   Set `server`, `server_name`, and the DNS you want. `server_name` must match
   the server certificate's CN/SAN.

2. Put your mTLS certificates in `dist\certs\`:
   - `ca.crt`     — CA that signed the server certificate
   - `client.crt` — your client certificate
   - `client.key` — your client private key (**keep private**)

   These are issued by the server operator. The paths in the profile
   (`certs\ca.crt`, ...) are relative to the folder you run the EXE from.

Your `dist\` folder should end up like:
```
dist\
├─ vpn-client.exe
├─ wintun.dll
├─ profile.client.toml
└─ certs\ { ca.crt, client.crt, client.key }
```

---

## Run

Open a terminal **as Administrator**, then:

```bat
cd dist
vpn-client.exe -profile profile.client.toml -full-route -timeout 0
```

- `-full-route` — route **all** traffic through the tunnel (real VPN).
- `-timeout 0` — run until you press `Ctrl+C` (on exit it restores routes/DNS).
- DNS from the profile is applied to the tunnel automatically.

A `masque0` Wintun adapter appears while connected. Verify your exit IP:
```bat
curl -4 http://ifconfig.me/ip
```
It should show the **server's** IP, not your ISP's.

### Command-line flags

| Flag           | Default | Meaning                                                        |
|----------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-profile`     | (req.)  | Path to the client profile TOML                                |
| `-full-route`  | false   | Route all traffic via the tunnel (real VPN)                    |
| `-timeout`     | 25s     | Overall timeout; use `0` to run until Ctrl+C                   |
| `-verbose`     | false   | Verbose per-packet diagnostics (troubleshooting only)          |
| `-test`        | true    | Test mode: route only `-test-dst` via TUN (safe on a server)   |
| `-test-dst`    | 1.1.1.1 | Test-mode destination                                          |
| `-ping`        | 3       | Test-mode ICMP echo count                                      |

For a normal VPN you only need `-profile` and `-full-route` (with `-timeout 0`).

## How it works

- `internal/clientcore` is platform-independent: it dials QUIC, does mTLS,
  opens a CONNECT-IP session, and forwards packets between a `tun.Device` and
  the tunnel. It never touches the OS routing table.
- `cmd/vpn-client/iface_windows.go` does the Windows-specific part: creates the
  Wintun adapter, assigns the server-issued address, installs a `0.0.0.0/0`
  route plus a host route to the server via the original gateway (so QUIC does
  not loop), and sets DNS on `masque0` (restored on exit).
- The same `main.go` builds for Linux via `iface_linux.go` (Go build tags).

---

## Troubleshooting

- **"wintun.dll not found"** — keep `wintun.dll` in the same folder as the EXE.
- **"Access is denied" / adapter not created** — run the terminal as
  Administrator.
- **No connectivity but adapter is up** — check `server` / `server_name` and
  that your `certs\` match the server's CA. Add `-verbose` for packet traces.
- **Build fails on `go mod download`** — ensure internet access and Go 1.21+.

---

## Security

- Never commit real `*.crt` / `*.key` or a filled-in `profile.client.toml` —
  `.gitignore` already excludes them.
- `client.key` is a secret; treat the whole `certs\` folder as sensitive.

## Limitations

- IPv4 inside the tunnel only.
- In-tunnel DNS is plaintext UDP:53 (hidden from your local ISP, visible at the
  server). DoH/DoT is future work.
- Single server/profile.
